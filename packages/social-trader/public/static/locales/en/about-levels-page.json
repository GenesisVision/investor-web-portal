    "text-5": "The Success of the trading manager is calculated with the help of the Genesis Ratio, which is the ratio of the program profit to its risk. The formula is similar to the Sharpe ratio and is set in a range from 0 to 1. If Genesis Ratio <0.2, then the program is high risk and the Investment scale is limited to 1 meaning that the manager can attract no more than his own deposit.",
    "text-6": "This is a multiplier of the volume traded by the manager relative to the program balance for all periods. It is calculated similarly to the Genesis Ratio, being a weighted average over all periods.",
    "text-7": "To have a volume multiplier of 1 the managers weekly trading volume needs to be approximately the same as the amount of funds in his/her program. In the case of Forex programs, the volume is divided by the shoulder.",
    "text-8": "The coefficient is designed so that trading more in one period can compensate for the lack of volume during another period, but one-time high volumes won’t compensate for the lack of trading.",
