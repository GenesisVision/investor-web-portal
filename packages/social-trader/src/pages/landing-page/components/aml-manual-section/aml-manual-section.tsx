              <p>Definition</p>
              <p>
                Money laundering is a process of concealing the true origin and
                ownership of illegally obtained money. Principally, it is
                proceeds of criminal activities such as illicit drugs,
                corruption, organized crime, fraud, sex trade, forgery, illegal
                logging/fishing, revenue evasion, counterfeit money, piracy,
                terrorism etc... which criminals attempt to disguise.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Money laundering process</p>
              <p>
                There is more than one method of laundering money. Methods can
                range from purchase and resale of real estate or a luxury item
                to passing money through a complex web of legitimate businesses
                and &#x27;shell&#x27; companies. In most cases, the proceeds of
                these criminal activities take the form of cash. There are three
                stages of money laundering, during which there may be numerous
                transactions made by launderers that could alert us.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Placement</p>
              <p>
                Placement is the physical disposal of the cash or asset derived
                from illegal activity. It includes the opening of numerous bank
                accounts, depositing cash, exporting cash, and using cash to
                purchase high value goods such as property or businesses.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Layering</p>
              <p>
                Layering is the separation of criminal proceeds from their
                source by creating complex layering process of financial
                transactions designed to defeat the audit trail and provide
                anonymity. It may include telegraphically transferring funds
                overseas, depositing cash overseas, reselling goods previously
                with cash.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Integration</p>
              <p>
                Integration provides apparent legitimacy to criminally derived
                wealth. If the layering process succeeds, integration schemes
                place the laundered funds back into the economy so that they
                re-enter the financial system appearing to be legitimate
                business funds. This may be achieved through a complex web of
                transfers or income from apparently legitimate businesses
                previously purchased with the proceeds of illegal activities.

          <p>WHAT IS FINANCING OF TERRORISM?</p>
          <p>
            Terrorist financing involves collecting and providing funds for
            terrorist activity. The primary objective of terrorism is &#x27;to
            intimidate a population, or to compel a Government or an
            international organization to do or abstain from doing any
            act&#x27;. The goal of the terrorist or terrorist organization is to
            maintain financial support in order to achieve their aims, and a
            successful terrorist group, is one that is able to build and
            maintain an effective financial infrastructure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Terrorist needs finance for a wide variety of purpose - recruitment,
            training, travel, materials and setting up safe havens.
          </p>
          <p>
            Terrorist control funds from a variety of sources around the world
            and employ sophisticated techniques to move funds between
            jurisdictions. In order not to be detected, a terrorist group draws
            in the service of banks and non banking institutions and takes
            advantage of their services products.
          </p>
          <p>Financing Terrorism and Associated activities</p>
          <p>
            If a known terrorist organization conducts or seeks to conduct a
            transaction via the business (whether or not the transaction or
            proposed transaction involves cash), such transaction or proposed
            transaction is deemed to be a suspicious transaction and the
            business must submit to the International Money-Laundering
            Information Network (IMoLIN).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>

          <p>Our AML &amp; CTF Program</p>
          <p>
            Our AML &amp; CTF Program is made up of the contents of this manual.
            Our activities can be described as a series of controls to manage
            the way we:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Accept applications for transactions;</li>
            <li>
              Monitor the transactions we do for unusual activity that needs
              further investigation;
            </li>
            <li>Identify events that require us to take further action</li>
            <li>Report certain matters to our IMoLIN; and</li>
            <li>Keep records of what we do</li>
          </ul>
          <p>GENERAL AND SPECIFIC PROVISIONS CONCERNING MONEY LAUNDERING</p>
          <p>
            Generally, Money Laundering occurs in three stages. Cash first
            enters the financial system at the &quot;placement&quot; stage,
            where the cash generated from criminal activities is converted into
            monetary instruments, such as money orders or traveler&#x27;s
            checks, or deposited into accounts at financial institutions. At the
            &quot;layering&quot; stage, the funds are transferred or moved into
            other accounts or other financial institutions to further separate
            the money from its criminal origin. At the &quot;integration&quot;
            stage, the funds are reintroduced into the economy and used to
            purchase legitimate assets or to fund other criminal activities or
            legitimate businesses. Terrorist Financing may not involve the
            proceeds of criminal conduct, but rather an attempt to conceal the
            origin or intended use of the funds, which will later be used for
            criminal purposes. Both individual employees and the Company itself
            are liable for criminal conduct if any of the offences below are
            charged by authorities. Money Laundering offences can be distributed
            as follows:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Arrangements relating to criminal property - It is an offence to
              enter into arrangements which will facilitate acquisition,
              retention or use of criminal property. It is a defense that the
              employee reported his knowledge or suspicion to the law
              enforcement agencies via internal reporting procedures at the
              first available opportunity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tipping off - it is an offence to disclose information which is
              likely to prejudice and investigation either to the person who is
              the subject of a money laundering suspicion or any person other
              than the law enforcement agencies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Acquisition, use of possession of criminal property - it is an
              offence to acquire, use or possess criminal property
            </li>
            <li>
              Handling the proceeds of corruption - corruption by government
              leaders and public sector officials inevitably involves serious
              crimes. Not only is there a major reputational risk in handling
              proceeds from such activities, but criminal charges and
              constructive trust suits can arise.
            </li>
            <li>
              Failure to report - It is an offence for a person who knows or
              suspects or has reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting that
              another is engaged in money laundering not to report such
              knowledge or suspicion as soon as reasonably practical to the
              authorities via internal reporting procedures.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>

            credible sources as having inadequate anti-money laundering
            standards or representing high-risk for crime and corruption. The
            Company will apply more stringent standards to the transactions
            carried out by clients or beneficial owners domiciled in such
            countries.
          </p>
          <p>OFFSHORE JURISDICTIONS</p>

          <p>HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES</p>
          <p>

          <p>MONITORING AND REPORTING</p>
          <p>
            We need to keep records of our business to meet various legal
            requirements of the Republic of Ireland and ensure all transactions
            can be readily constructed at any time.
          </p>
          <p>
            All applications and documents produced to verify identity must be

          </p>
          <p>
            Transaction based monitoring will occur within the appropriate
            business units of GENESIS VISION LP. Monitoring of specific
            transactions will include but is not limited to transactions
            aggregating equivalent price of USD 1100 or more and those with
            respect to which GENESIS VISION LP, has a reason to suspect
            suspicious activity. All reports will be documented.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where a transaction exceeds the parameters as set out and should
            client&#x27;s response be unsatisfactory or cause the Company to
            form a suspicion, staff are obliged to consult with the Director
            responsible for that client to document and file a suspicious
            transaction report.
          </p>
          <p>
            All Reports made to the IMoLIN must be done with the written
            authorization of the Director and be discussed with the
            Company&#x27;s Compliance Officer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Staff are made aware that a suspicious transaction report made to
            the GENESIS VISION LP. must not be disclosed to the client or
            parties involved in the reported transaction. It must be
            confidential between the Company and the IMoLIN.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY</p>
          <p>
            A suspicious transaction will often be one which is inconsistent
            with a Customer&#x27;s know legitimate business. Emphasis will
            therefore be placed on knowing the customer&#x27;s business and
            his/her requirements. It is the responsibility of all staff to
            report knowledge or suspicion of money laundering.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are signs of suspicious activity that suggest money
            laundering. These are commonly referred to as &quot;red flags.&quot;
            If a red flag is detected, additional due diligence will be
            performed before proceeding with the transaction. If a reasonable
            explanation is not determined, the suspicious activity shall be
            reported to the AML Compliance Committee.
          </p>
          <p>Examples of red flags are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The customer exhibits unusual concern regarding the Company&#x27;s
              compliance with government reporting requirements and the
              firm&#x27;s AML policies, particularly with respect to his or her
              identity, type of business and assets, or is reluctant or refuses
              to reveal any information concerning business activities, or
              furnishes unusual or suspect identification or business documents.
            </li>
            <li>
              The customer wishes to engage in transactions that lack business
              sense or apparent investment strategy, or are inconsistent with
              the Customer&#x27;s stated business strategy.
            </li>
            <li>
              The information provided by the customer that identifies a
              legitimate source for funds is false, misleading, or substantially
              incorrect.
            </li>
            <li>
              Upon request, the customer refuses to identify or fails to
              indicate any legitimate source for his or her funds and other
              assets.
            </li>
            <li>
              The customer has a questionable background or is the subject of
              news report indicating possible criminal, civil or regulatory
              violations.
            </li>
            <li>
              The customer exhibits a lack of concern regarding risks,
              commissions, or other transaction costs.
            </li>
            <li>
              The customer appears to be acting as an agent for an undisclosed
              principal, but declines or is reluctant, without legitimate
              commercial reasons, to provide information or is otherwise evasive
              regarding that person or entity.
            </li>
            <li>
              The customer has difficulty describing the nature of his or her
              business or lacks general knowledge of his or her industry.
            </li>
            <li>
              The customer engages in transactions involving cash or cash
              equivalents or other monetary instruments that appear to be
              structured to avoid the government reporting requirements,
              especially if the cash or monetary instruments are in an amount
              just below reporting or recording thresholds.
            </li>
            <li>
              The customer&#x27;s account has unexplained or sudden extensive
              wire activity, especially in accounts that had little or no
              previous activity.
            </li>
            <li>
              The customer&#x27;s account has a large number of wire transfers
              to unrelated third parties inconsistent with the customer&#x27;s
              legitimate business purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
              The customer makes a funds deposit followed by an immediate
              request that the money be wired out or transferred to a third
              party, or to another firm, without any apparent business purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
              The customer engages in excessive journal entries between
              unrelated accounts without any apparent business purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
              The customer&#x27;s account shows an unexplained high level of
              account activity with very low levels of securities transactions.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>INVESTIGATION</p>
          <p>
            Upon notification to the AML Compliance committee an investigation
            will be commenced to determine if a report should be made to
            appropriate law enforcement or regulatory agencies. The
            investigation will include, but not necessarily be limited to,
            review of all available information, such as payment history,
            birthdates and address. With the results of the investigation
            warrant, a recommendation will be made to the AML Compliance
            Committee to file a blocked assets and/or a SAR with the appropriate
            law enforcement or regulatory agency.
          </p>
          <p>
            The AML Compliance Committee is responsible for any notice or filing
            with law enforcement or regulatory agency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Investigation results will not be disclosed or discussed with anyone
            other than those who have a legitimate need to know. Under no
            circumstances shall any officer, employee or appointed agent
            disclose or discuss any AML concern, investigation, notice or SAR
            filing with the person or persons subject of such, or any other
            person, including members of the officer&#x27;s , employee&#x27;s or
            appointed agent&#x27;s family. Confidentiality whilst and
            investigation is ongoing is of the utmost importance and employees
            are reminded of the offence of &quot;tipping- off&quot;. GENESIS
            VISION LP., has the right to terminate the agreement with the client
            immediately and to prohibit the client from withdrawing any assets
            if the explanations provided are inadequate or in conflict with the
            AML Policy.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>INTERNAL AUDIT</p>
          <p>
            The AML Compliance Committee and the audit functions are segregated
            to ensure that the activities of the compliance function are subject
            to an independent review. The Compliance officer will periodically
            arrange for this manual to be reviewed by and independent person for
            compliance and adequacy. The audit function, should of course, keep
            the compliance informed of any audit findings relating to
            compliance. The Compliance Officer cannot do this review, nor can a
            member of her or his staff. The report of the independent review
            will be provided to the owner as the Compliance Officer and the
            Compliance officer will undertake required remediation actions
            identified in the report if they are practicable and appropriate.
