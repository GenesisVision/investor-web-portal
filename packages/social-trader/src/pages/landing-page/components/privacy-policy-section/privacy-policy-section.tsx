        <p>
          A cookie is a small amount of data that often includes a unique
          identifier that is sent to your computer or device browser from a
          website's computer and is stored on your device's hard drive for
          tracking site usage. A website may send its own cookie to your browser
          if your browser's preferences allow it, but, to protect your privacy,
          your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has
          already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other websites.

          track online traffic flows. When you visit our website, our system

          personally.
