        <p>
          <b>By balance.</b> When choosing this subscription, the volume of the
          position opened is proportional to the trading account balance of the
          leader and the follower. For example, Provider balance = 100 USD, he
          opens a trade with a volume of 10 USD. Subscriber balance = 20 USD,
          this means it will open the position for the same asset but with a
          volume of 5 times lower which is 2 USD.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Percentage.</b> When you choose this subscription, you set the
          volume percentage of the Provider’s opened position that the
          subscription will copy. Meaning if the Provider has opened a trade for
          100 USD while the percentage the Subscriber has set is 30%, it will
          open the trade on the Subscriber trade account for 30 USD.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Fixed.</b> By choosing this subscription type, the positions will
          open only for the fixed amount that the Subscriber has set in the USD
          equivalent field when subscribing to the signal program/trading
          account. It does not depend on the size of the trade of the provider.
        </p>
        <p>
          For each subscription type, you will need to set a{" "}
          <b>Tolerance percentage</b> (maximum possible deviation of the trade
          price from 0% to 20%). This means if you set it to 0% for the chosen
          subscription type, the trade must open at the exact same price as the
          provider’s trade. If a subscriber's price at the moment of the opening

            The "Using GVT to pay for fees" function must be enabled. The fee
