              Money laundering is a process of concealing the true origin and
              ownership of illegally obtained money. Principally, it is proceeds
              of criminal activities such as illicit drugs, corruption,
              organized crime, fraud, sex trade, forgery, illegal
              logging/fishing, revenue evasion, counterfeit money, piracy,

              cash. There are three stages of money laundering, during which
              there may be numerous transactions made by launderers that could

              Layering is the separation of criminal proceeds from their source
              by creating complex layering process of financial transactions
              designed to defeat the audit trail and provide anonymity. It may
              include telegraphically transferring funds overseas, depositing
              cash overseas, reselling goods previously with cash.

              re-enter the financial system appearing to be legitimate business
              funds. This may be achieved through a complex web of transfers or
              income from apparently legitimate businesses previously purchased
              with the proceeds of illegal activities.

              Generally, Money Laundering occurs in three stages. Cash first
              enters the financial system at the &quot;placement&quot; stage,
              where the cash generated from criminal activities is converted
              into monetary instruments, such as money orders or traveler&#39;s
              checks, or deposited into accounts at financial institutions. At
              the &quot;layering&quot; stage, the funds are transferred or moved
              into other accounts or other financial institutions to further
              separate the money from its criminal origin. At the
              &quot;integration&quot; stage, the funds are reintroduced into the
              economy and used to purchase legitimate assets or to fund other
              criminal activities or legitimate businesses. Terrorist Financing
              may not involve the proceeds of criminal conduct, but rather an
              attempt to conceal the origin or intended use of the funds, which
              will later be used for criminal purposes. Both individual
              employees and the Company itself are liable for criminal conduct
              if any of the offences below are charged by authorities. Money
              Laundering offences can be distributed as follows:

              by and independent person for compliance and adequacy. The audit
